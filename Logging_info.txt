Here’s an example of how you might use logging.basicConfig():

import logging

# Setting up basic configuration for logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Setting the logging level
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Formatting the log messages
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]  # Outputting logs to the console
)

# Example logging calls
logging.debug("This is a debug message.")
logging.info("This is an info message.")
logging.warning("This is a warning message.")
logging.error("This is an error message.")
logging.critical("This is a critical message.")
Parameters for basicConfig():
level: Sets the threshold for the logger. It can be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL.

format: Defines the structure of the log message. You can use placeholders like %(asctime)s, %(levelname)s, %(message)s, etc.

handlers: Specifies where the log messages should be sent (e.g., to the console, a file, or elsewhere). You can use handlers like StreamHandler() (for the console) or FileHandler() (to log into a file).

filename: If specified, it directs the log messages to a file.

This is a simple and effective way to set up logging for your Python application! Let me know if you need more specific details or examples.



You said:
%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

ChatGPT said:
The format string '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s' that you're referring to is a way to customize the appearance of log messages in Python. Here's a breakdown of each component:

%(asctime)s:

This is a placeholder for the timestamp when the log message is created.

It will insert the current date and time in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,SSS (e.g., 2025-04-05 15:30:45,123).

This is useful to track when a specific log entry was made.

%(levelname)s:

This placeholder represents the severity level of the log message.

Examples of levels include: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.

It helps to categorize the log entry based on its importance or severity.

%(message)s:

This is where the actual log message content will go. It represents the message you pass to the logging function (e.g., logging.info("This is an info message.")).

This is the main content of your log entry.

Example of output:
Here’s an example of how the logs would appear when using the format string '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s':

text
Copy
2025-04-05 15:30:45,123 - DEBUG - This is a debug message.
2025-04-05 15:30:45,124 - INFO - This is an info message.
2025-04-05 15:30:45,125 - WARNING - This is a warning message.
2025-04-05 15:30:45,126 - ERROR - This is an error message.
2025-04-05 15:30:45,127 - CRITICAL - This is a critical message.
Example of setting it up:
python
Copy
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Set the logging level to DEBUG
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Custom format
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]  # Output to the console
)

# Example log statements
logging.debug("This is a debug message.")
logging.info("This is an info message.")
logging.warning("This is a warning message.")
logging.error("This is an error message.")
logging.critical("This is a critical message.")
This format is useful for tracking log entries with the date and time, and helps you quickly understand the type and content of each log message.
